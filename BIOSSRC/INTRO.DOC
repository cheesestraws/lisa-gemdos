The gemdos O/S contains generic elements referred to as the BDOS.  These
files are common to all gemdos O/S systems.  In addition, there is a hardware
specific part of the O/S.  This is called the bios.

The following files make up the bdos:  rwa.s, sup.c, fs.c, gemerror.h, fs.h,
mem.c, time.c, and con.c.

In the lisa bios, the following files make up its bios:  biosa.s, conio.c,
rdabs.c, sony.c, lisaesc.c, 8x12.c and endpgm.  It should be noted that
sony.c is used for lisas which have 3 1/2 inch floppies and twiggy.c is
used for lisas with 5 1/4 inch floppies.  The decision as to which module
(either twiggy or sony) to link in is thus solely dependent upon the type
of floppy drive you have in your system.  At the current time, the timer
tick items found in these 2 modules are current in sony.c but not in twiggy.


For the lisabios, lo.sub is the submit file to link together the various
Gemdos O/S modules.  The order in which the modules are linked is unimportant
except that biosa.s should always be linked in first.
